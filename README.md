# Jupyter Notebooks for visualizing functions
This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks written in Python, which visualize and animate functions arising as solutions to PDEs:

* Visualize Functions: explains contour/color plots, surface graphs, and animations
* Visualize sine series: explores the convergence of sine series for functions with various smoothness properties
* Visualize general series: visualizes the convergence properties of arbitrary series arising in Sturm-Liouville problems.

These notebooks require ipywidgets, math, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.
