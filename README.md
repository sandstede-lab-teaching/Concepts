# Jupyter Notebooks for visualizing functions
This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks written in Python, which visualize and animate functions arising as solutions to PDEs:

* **Convolutions:** interactive illustration of the geometric interpretation of the convolution of two functions
* **Visualize Functions:** explains contour/color plots, surface graphs, and animations
* **Visualize sine series:** explores the convergence of sine series for functions with various smoothness properties
* **Visualize general series:** visualizes the convergence properties of arbitrary series arising in Sturm-Liouville problems.

If you would like to run these notebooks in your webbrowser using Binder, click on the badge below. It may take time for Binder to start the Jupyterlab, and the notebooks may also run significantly slower than when ran locally.

Alternatively, install a JupyterLab with a Python 3 kernel locally using, for instance, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)). If the command `%matplotlib widget` results in an error, replace it with `%matplotlib notebook`.
