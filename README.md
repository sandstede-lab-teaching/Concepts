# Jupyter Notebooks for visualizing functions
This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks written in Python, which visualize and animate functions arising as solutions to PDEs:

* Convolutions: interactive illustration of the geometric interpretation of the convolution of two functions
* Visualize Functions: explains contour/color plots, surface graphs, and animations
* Visualize sine series: explores the convergence of sine series for functions with various smoothness properties
* Visualize general series: visualizes the convergence properties of arbitrary series arising in Sturm-Liouville problems.

These notebooks run on a JupyterLab (which can be installed using, for instance, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)) with a Python 3 kernel. The notebooks require the modules ipywidgets, math, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy. If IPython is used, replace `%matplotlib widget` with `%matplotlib notebook` in each notebook.
